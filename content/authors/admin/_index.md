      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm currently a Research Associate (AI Engineer) at Mayo Clinic (Scottsdale, AZ), where I research, build, and deploy end-to-end AI (LLM-based) systems that streamline clinical workflows and improve patient outcomes. My role focuses on the full AI engineering lifecycle, from problem formulation and model development to deployment, applying AI to solve real-world healthcare challenges.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Brandeis University (Waltham, MA), where I developed ML/AI models (deep learning, reinforcement learning) to forecast and control active materials. 

I bring extensive experience in AI/ML across diverse domains, including time series analysis, computer vision, deep learning, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and agentic AI, with a proven ability to translate complex problems into deployable AI solutions.
